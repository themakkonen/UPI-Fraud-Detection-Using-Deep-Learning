Abstract:
 The surge in UPI-based digital payments has been accompanied by a parallel increase in fraudulent 
activities, posing significant financial risks. This research investigates the application of deep 
learning models, specifically Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Autoencoders, for real-time 
detection of fraudulent UPI transactions. LSTM, owing to its ability to capture sequential 
dependencies, is employed to analyze transaction patterns over time, identifying anomalies indicative 
of fraudulent behavior. Conversely, Autoencoders are utilized to learn a compressed representation of 
normal transactions, enabling the detection of deviations through reconstruction errors. By combining 
the strengths of both models, a robust fraud detection system is developed. Experimental results 
demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in accurately identifying fraudulent transactions, 
thereby enhancing the security of UPI payments and mitigating financial losses
